- When I was about three years old, My Mom was puzzled, and sometimes terrified, by my ability to _**crack glasses** with my teeth_ while I was drinking from them. She quickly learned to keep a mustard glass handy for coffee shop outings. The secret was simple. My lower jaw was set beck quite a bit, and glasses fit neatly in the gap between upper and lower teeth. It took some years of effort from an orthodontics specialist to bring my teeth into proper alignment.

- Around age three or four, riding a bus with my Grandma was my introduction to reading. **Neon signs**, plentiful in Warsaw at the time, were a great teaching tool. They were colourful, artsy, and their designs varied. She read them out for me, and pretty soon I caught up. I could read well by the age of 5. I also had the obligatory _letter blocks,_ just like the ones available today.

- My Mom's great-grandfather&mdash;on her father's father's side&mdash;has set up the original **_Institute for Smallpox Vaccination_** in Warsaw, when Poland was still partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany. It was a _very_ successful family business, popular because the occupying power (Russia) did not provide a public vaccination service.

- My other Great-grandfather&mdash;on my maternal grandmother's side&mdash;was Russian. He travelled to Russia during the **1917 Bolshevik Revolution**, and subsequently died in one of Stalin's purges.

- My Mother's father was the founder, and Editor-In-Chief for many years, of a successful health education magazine **_Zdrowie_** ("Health" in Polish) that is still in print as of today. I heard that the initial issue was written and illustrated as a cooperative effort of many members of my extended family.

- My Father, Grzegorz Moryci≈Ñski, was a fine artist, a **painter**. He spent the years of Second World War as a small child in **Siberia**. He was rounded up and sent to Abakan near Irkutsk, along with his mother and grandmother. I am not sure what was the fate of his father, but I know that he survived the war.

- My Mother worked as a tour organizer for artistic groups - an **_impresario._** Her work sent her to various foreign countries, sometimes beyond the Iron Curtain. She brought with her many gifts and gadgets. They gave me a distinct impression that the West is waay ahead of Poland in terms of availability and **quality** of goods available in stores.
