      <description>My Mom&amp;rsquo;s great-grandfather—on her father&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s side—has set up the original Institute for Smallpox Vaccination in Warsaw, when Poland was still partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany. It was a very successful family business, popular because the occupying power (Russia) did not provide a public vaccination service.
  My other Great-grandfather—on my maternal grandmother&amp;rsquo;s side—was Russian. He travelled to Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and subsequently died in one of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s purges.</description>

      <description>I always loved science-fiction. My favourite writer was a famous Polish author Stanisław Lem. He is not as well known in English-speaking countries, but many of his books were translated into multiple languages. One of his novels, &amp;ldquo;Solaris,&amp;rdquo; was made into a movie, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002).
Lem abandoned standard science-fiction genre quite early, as American SF of the day was according to him, pulp-quality fiction.</description>

      <description>Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s typewriter was my first writing instrument. Using it had many advantages over scribbling. There was no need to learn to hold a pen, no risk of smearing. It even held paper for me. The resulting text was usually perfectly legible, as long as the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! – at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys.</description>
