      <description>Dear reader, I have a confession to make. Many years ago, I met a high school friend. Her name I will keep to myself. She was a strong, dare I say fanatical, believer in the Catholic religion. Once, in an emotional conversation, she simply said &amp;ldquo;God loves you Matthew!&amp;rdquo; It must have been said at the right time and place because the orbs of my inner world suddenly started to turn.</description>

      <description>As a young person, I loved science-fiction. My favourite writer was a famous Polish author Stanisław Lem. He is not as well known in English-speaking countries. However, many of his books were translated into multiple languages, including English. One of his novels, &amp;ldquo;Solaris,&amp;rdquo; was made into a movie, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002).&#xA;Lem was not entirely a science-fiction writer. He actually gave up writing in standard science-fiction genre quite early.</description>

      <description>My Mom&amp;rsquo;s great-grandfather — on her father&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s side — has set up the original Institute for Smallpox Vaccination in Warsaw, when Poland was still partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany. It was a very successful family business, popular because the occupying power (Russia) did not provide a public vaccination service.&#xA;My other great-grandfather — on my maternal grandmother&amp;rsquo;s side — was Russian. He travelled to Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and subsequently died in one of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s purges.</description>

      <description>Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s typewriter was my first writing instrument. Using it had advantages over scribbling. There was no need to learn to hold a pen, no risk of smearing. It even held the paper for me. The resulting text was usually perfectly legible, as long as the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! – at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys.</description>
