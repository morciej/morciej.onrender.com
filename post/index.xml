      <description>Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s typewriter was my first writing instrument. This had many advantages: no need to learn to hold a pen; no risk of smearing; it held paper for me. Legibility of text was perfect, if the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! â€“ at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys. I quickly learned that there were many ways to write the same word, and made sure to ask Mom for correct spelling.</description>
