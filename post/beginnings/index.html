			<p><strong>Grandpa&rsquo;s typewriter</strong> was my first writing instrument. This had many advantages: no need to learn to hold a pen; no risk of smearing; it held paper for me. Legibility of text was perfect, if the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! – at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys. I quickly learned that there were many ways to write the same word, and made sure to ask Mom for correct spelling.</p>
<p>I could never do it in English; we all know how chaotic and unpredictable English orthography is. <strong>Polish spelling</strong> is mostly phonetical, with few predictable exceptions. An occasional shout to Mom was enough for me to produce a <em>mostly</em> correct text.</p>
<p>As I grew, it quickly became apparent that my family gained a <strong>geek.</strong> My biggest childhood interests were:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Astronomy and astronautics,</strong> obviously due to the resounding success of the Apollo program. Illustrated articles about it were presented in shiny colour, unavailable to Polish publishers, on the pages of US embassy publication &ldquo;America&rdquo; that my Grandpa subscribed to. The impression it made on me was later a big factor in my dreams of life across the Atlantic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Chemistry,</strong> mentored by my uncle&rsquo;s friend, who was a geologist, as well as my grandpa the doctor. I got myself a little book by Stefan Sękowski, a chemistry popularizer par excellence. Soon I was trying to set up a home lab, bending glass tubing over a gas kitchen, and producing oxygen from potassium permanganate. I wasn&rsquo;t into explosions; my passion was to <em>understand how things work.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aviation,</strong> as an airfield was nearby, and planes and helicopters flew frequently over our house. I made some airplane models from kits, with much help from my Dad, who was handy with such things. He also made sure I actually finished projects before starting new ones. If, as could be expected, I started yet another endeavour because I got bored with the previous one, he would say &ldquo;Hayfire! You have to learn to finish!&rdquo; Very true!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Later came a lifelong fascination with <strong>electronics</strong> and radio communications. One of family friends, Wojtek Zawistowski, was a computer engineer—mainframes of course, it was the &rsquo;70s—and a ham radio operator, as now-silent key SP5GM. He was legally blind, an <strong>inventor,</strong> and <strong>entrepreneur.</strong> He encouraged my interest in radio, and gave me many electronic parts, with which I constructed my first circuits. I soon used my uncle&rsquo;s book of electronic projects for inspiration and advice. By the end of primary school, I have built a couple of things that were actually useful.</p>
<h4 id="books">Books</h4>
<p>I always loved <strong>science-fiction.</strong> My favourite writer was a famous Polish author <strong>Stanisław Lem.</strong> He is not as well known in English-speaking countries, but many of his books were translated into multiple languages. One of his novels, &ldquo;Solaris,&rdquo; was made into a movie, first in the USSR, and later in the USA.</p>
<p>Lem abandoned standard science-fiction genre quite early, as it was associated with pulp-quality fiction. He developed his own style, based on the idea of a civilization of robots, with distinct traits of a medieval culture. English translations, by the excellent translator <strong>Michael Kandel,</strong> use a style based on the writings of <strong>Chaucer,</strong> to convey a similar feeling. It evokes vague associations with <em>steampunk.</em></p>
<p>Science and technology is there, but mostly as an excuse to tell excellent stories. They relate to Lem&rsquo;s philosophical thoughts, as well as contemporary issues at the time of writing. Lem later said &ldquo;People thought I was writing comedy, but really, I did because steam was coming out of my ears!&rdquo; <strong>Example:</strong> a story about an orchestra where all instruments were broken, and once they were replaced, a monster came out of a cage and started <em>eating</em> the musicians. We all knew it was about communist politics.</p>
<h4 id="now-for-the-anecdote">Now for the anecdote</h4>
<p>My family lived in a two-story row housing unit. As a toddler, I was usually let loose upstairs, with a wooden fence blocking my access to the staircase. At the top of the stairs stood our beautiful, big, Chinese copper vase. It was covered with cobalt blue laque, and had a design of slender flowers. I believe it was a pre-war antique, a big one – at least a metre high. One day, everyone was startled by horrible banging. My Mom almost had a heart attack, thinking I must have fallen down the stairs, but it was the vase. I managed to reach so far past the fence that I pushed it down. Apparently, I was born with some traits of a cat!</p>
<p>We kept that vase, so I became intimately familiar with its wounded and cracked nature, a reminder that <em>things pushed off stairs do break,</em> sometimes irreparably.</p>
<h3 id="trivia">Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>My Mom was puzzled, and terrified, by my ability to <em>crack glasses with my teeth</em> while I was drinking from them. She quickly learned to keep a mustard glass handy for coffee shop outings.</li>
<li>Riding a bus with my Grandma was my introduction to reading, with help from neon signs. She read them out for me, and pretty soon I caught up. I could read books by the age of 5. I also had the obligatory <em>letter blocks.</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="family-historical-facts">Family historical facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My Mom&rsquo;s great-grandfather on her father&rsquo;s side, has set up the original <em>Institute for Smallpox Vaccination</em> in Warsaw, when Poland was still partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany. It was a <em>very</em> successful family business.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My other great-grandfather—on maternal grandmother&rsquo;s side—was Russian. He travelled to Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and subsequently died in one of Stalin&rsquo;s purges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Mom&rsquo;s father was the founder, and Editor-In-Chief, of a successful health education magazine <strong><em>Zdrowie</em></strong> (&ldquo;Health&rdquo; in Polish) that is still in print as of today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Dad, Grzegorz Moryciński, was a fine artist, a painter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My Mom worked as a tour organizer for artistic groups - an <em>impresario.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
