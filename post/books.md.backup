I always loved **science-fiction.** My favourite writer was a famous Polish author **Stanis≈Çaw Lem.** He is not as well known in English-speaking countries, but many of his books were translated into multiple languages. One of his novels, "Solaris," was made into a movie, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002).

Lem abandoned standard science-fiction genre quite early, as American SF of the day was according to him, pulp-quality fiction. He aimed to write more interesting stories that are set in far away worlds, but only incidentally. His initilal works were "serious science fiction," but the successful series "The Cyberiad" was based on the idea of a civilization of robots, with distinct traits of a medieval culture. English translations, by the excellent **Michael Kandel,** are written in a style based on the language of **Chaucer,** to convey an impression of "ancient times," but with ubiquitous, all-pervasive technology. It evokes vague associations with _steampunk,_ but that's a superficial similarity. They are fun, and you really should read them.

Most of his works are grounded in Lem's philosophical thinking, as well as contemporary issues at the time of writing. Lem later said "People thought I was writing comedy, but really, I did it because steam was coming out of my ears!" **Example:** a story about an orchestra, where all instruments were fake. Once the musicians complained, the instruments were replaced with real ones, but the jubilation did not last. A monster came out of a cage and started _eating_ the musicians. I wonder what someone living in a democratic country would think about this setup? Living under Communist regime, we all understood the allusion to the repressive politics, and our "econo-joke" that produced substandard goods.

Eventually, I became familiar with most of Lem's books, and now I own his combined works. I read and re-read him to the detriment of my school work. My favourite way of procrastinating was to hide a book on my lap, and read it while I was pretending to do my homework. As a result, I went to sleep way too late, because well, the homework had to be done. I made up for it on Sunday mornings, sleeping until 1pm.
