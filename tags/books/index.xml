      <description>As a young person, I loved science-fiction. My favourite writer was a famous Polish author Stanis≈Çaw Lem. He is not as well known in English-speaking countries. However, many of his books were translated into multiple languages, including English. One of his novels, &amp;ldquo;Solaris,&amp;rdquo; was made into a movie, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002).&#xA;Lem was not entirely a science-fiction writer. He actually gave up writing in standard science-fiction genre quite early.</description>
