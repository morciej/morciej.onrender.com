      <description>Dear reader, I have a confession to make. Many years ago, I met a high school friend. Her name I will keep to myself. She was a strong, dare I say fanatical, believer in the Catholic religion. Once, in an emotional conversation, she simply said &amp;ldquo;God loves you Matthew!&amp;rdquo; It must have been said at the right time and place because the orbs of my inner world suddenly started to turn.</description>

      <description>Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s typewriter was my first writing instrument. Using it had advantages over scribbling. There was no need to learn to hold a pen, no risk of smearing. It even held the paper for me. The resulting text was usually perfectly legible, as long as the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! â€“ at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys.</description>
