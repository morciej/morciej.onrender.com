      <description>Grandpa&amp;rsquo;s typewriter was my first writing instrument. Using it had many advantages over scribbling. There was no need to learn to hold a pen, no risk of smearing. It even held paper for me. The resulting text was usually perfectly legible, as long as the reader overlooked a few words that were X-ed out. Of course, I had to learn to read first! â€“ at least well enough to be able to recognize characters shown on keys.</description>
