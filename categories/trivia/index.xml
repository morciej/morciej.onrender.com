      <description>My Mom&amp;rsquo;s great-grandfather—on her father&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s side—has set up the original Institute for Smallpox Vaccination in Warsaw, when Poland was still partitioned between Russia, Austria and Germany.

  My other Great-grandfather—on my maternal grandmother&amp;rsquo;s side—was Russian. He travelled to Russia during the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, and subsequently died in one of Stalin&amp;rsquo;s purges.</description>
