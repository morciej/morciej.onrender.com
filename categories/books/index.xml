      <description>I always loved science-fiction. My favourite writer was a famous Polish author Stanis≈Çaw Lem. He is not as well known in English-speaking countries, but many of his books were translated into multiple languages. One of his major novels, &amp;ldquo;Solaris,&amp;rdquo; was made into a movie on two occasions, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002). Unfortunately, their production values were much more solid than screenwriters&#39; understanding of Lem&amp;rsquo;s writing.</description>
