      <description>I always loved science-fiction. My favourite writer was a famous Polish author Stanis≈Çaw Lem. He is not as well known in English-speaking countries, but many of his books were translated into multiple languages. One of his novels, &amp;ldquo;Solaris,&amp;rdquo; was made into a movie, first in the USSR by Tarkovsky (1972), and later in the USA by Sodebergh (2002).
Lem abandoned standard science-fiction genre quite early, as American SF of the day was according to him, pulp-quality fiction.</description>
